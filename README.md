THINGS I LEARNED ALONG THE WAY

// css //
input[type=submit] -- add CSS to your input fields based off of the type of input. (text, number, submit)

// react //
use ternary operators to change class and manipulate elements, hide show, styles, etc.

// authentication stuff //
set input type to password and when entering a password into a field, it will show as dots instead of what you're typing
